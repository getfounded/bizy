## **Bizy Concepts**

### **Business Logic**
**Definition:** The part of a program that encodes real-world business rules determining how data can be created, stored, and changed. Business logic determines how and when to carry out operations such as transactions or calculations, building off applicable business rules.

**Context:** Business logic is contrasted with software concerned with lower-level details of managing databases, displaying user interfaces, or system infrastructure.

**Example:** An e-commerce checkout process that validates payment information, calculates taxes, applies discounts, and updates inventory levels.

**Related Terms:** Domain Logic, Business Rules, Business Logic Layer (BLL)

---

### **Domain Logic**
**Definition:** Logic that has to do purely with the domain problem, such as validating order details before dispatching them.

**Context:** Distinguished from application logic, domain logic focuses on core business concepts and rules specific to the problem domain.

**Example:** In banking software, domain logic would include interest rate calculations, loan eligibility criteria, and account balance validations.

**Related Terms:** Business Logic, Domain Model, Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

---

### **Business Rules**
**Definition:** Formal expressions of business policy. Business rules are declarative, while business logic is procedural.

**Context:** Anything that is neither a process nor a procedure is a business rule. For example, "every new visitor must be welcomed" is a business rule, while the welcoming process is business logic.

**Example:** "Customers must be 18 or older to create an account" (rule) vs. the age verification workflow (logic).

**Related Terms:** Business Logic, Business Policy, Compliance Rules

---

### **Application Logic**
**Definition:** Logic that has to do with application responsibilities, such as notifying a manager when specific revenue is reached or generating reports.

**Context:** Application logic bridges business logic and technical implementation, managing communication between user interface, database, and external services.

**Example:** Routing user requests, managing session state, coordinating API calls between services.

**Related Terms:** Workflow Logic, Service Logic, Orchestration Logic

---

## **Technical Architecture**

### **Business Logic Layer (BLL)**
**Definition:** The intermediate layer in 3-tier architecture that deals with data flow between the Data Access Layer (DAL) and User Interface (UI), responsible for handling business rules calculations and creating logic within applications.

**Context:** The BLL is stuck between the user interface and database layers, concentrating on grouping related functionality into distinct layers within applications.

**Example:** In an inventory management system, the BLL processes purchase orders, validates stock levels, and calculates reorder points.

**Related Terms:** Three-Tier Architecture, Presentation Layer, Data Access Layer, Service Layer

---

### **Three-Tier Architecture**
**Definition:** Architecture with presentation layer (user interface), business logic layer (processing and rules), and data access layer (database management).

**Context:** This layered approach decouples UI and database from logic, arranging it in a middle layer known as the backend.

**Example:** Web application with React frontend (presentation), Node.js API (business logic), and PostgreSQL database (data access).

**Related Terms:** N-Tier Architecture, Layered Architecture, Separation of Concerns

---

### **Service Layer**
