Feature: Cross-Framework Business Logic Orchestration
  As a business stakeholder
  I want to define business rules in natural language
  So that I can coordinate AI systems without technical complexity

  Background:
    Given the business logic orchestrator is running
    And all framework adapters are healthy
    And the MCP toolkit is connected at "/storage/mcp-tool-kit"

  Scenario: Premium customer escalation workflow
    Given a customer with the following attributes:
      | attribute       | value    |
      | tier           | premium  |
      | sentiment_score| 0.2      |
      | account_value  | 50000    |
    When a support interaction is created
    Then the orchestrator should execute the following sequence:
      | step | framework       | action                    |
      | 1    | langchain       | analyze_sentiment         |
      | 2    | temporal        | start_escalation_workflow |
      | 3    | mcp             | notify_account_manager    |
      | 4    | zep             | update_customer_context   |
    And the workflow should complete within 30 seconds
    And all framework responses should be successful

  Scenario: Multi-framework document processing pipeline
    Given LangChain document analyzer is available
    And Temporal workflow engine is running
    And MCP toolkit is connected at "/storage/mcp-tool-kit"
    And Semantic Kernel agents are ready
    When a customer uploads legal documents
    Then the system should:
      | framework       | action                           | expected_result     |
      | langchain       | extract_contract_terms          | terms_extracted     |
      | semantic_kernel | coordinate_legal_review_agents  | review_assigned     |
      | temporal        | orchestrate_approval_workflow   | workflow_started    |
      | mcp             | update_enterprise_systems       | systems_updated     |
    And the document should be processed within 5 minutes
    And all stakeholders should be notified

  Scenario Outline: Dynamic agent selection based on task complexity
    Given a task with complexity level "<complexity>"
    And the task type is "<task_type>"
    When the orchestrator evaluates the task
    Then it should route to "<primary_framework>" framework
    And use "<coordination_pattern>" coordination pattern
    And the estimated execution time should be "<max_time>"

    Examples:
      | complexity | task_type          | primary_framework | coordination_pattern | max_time |
      | simple     | data_lookup        | mcp              | direct_execution     | 5s       |
      | moderate   | content_analysis   | langchain        | chain_coordination   | 30s      |
      | complex    | multi_agent_task   | semantic_kernel  | multi_agent          | 300s     |
      | critical   | enterprise_workflow| temporal         | full_coordination    | 600s     |

  Scenario: Large dataset processing with FastMCP coordination
    Given data size is greater than 100
    And processing is required
    When the data pipeline is triggered
    Then FastMCP should batch process the data
    And MCP toolkit should transform the results
    And Zep should store processing context
    And all frameworks should coordinate successfully
    And the workflow should complete within 60 seconds

  Scenario: Knowledge extraction from enterprise documents
    Given a new enterprise customer
    And LangChain is available for document analysis
    And Semantic Kernel agents are ready
    And Zep memory system is available
    When the customer uploads legal documents
    Then LangChain should extract contract terms
    And Semantic Kernel should coordinate legal review agents
    And Zep should store document analysis context
    And all frameworks should coordinate successfully
