Feature: Enterprise Customer Service Automation
  As a customer service manager
  I want automated handling of customer interactions
  So that premium customers receive appropriate priority and escalation

  Background:
    Given the business logic orchestrator is running
    And all framework adapters are healthy
    And customer service systems are available

  Scenario: Premium customer with negative sentiment escalation
    Given a customer with tier "premium"
    And the customer sentiment score is below 0.3
    And the customer account value is above 50000
    When a support interaction is created
    Then analyze interaction details using LangChain
    And escalate to account manager via MCP toolkit
    And start priority support workflow via Temporal
    And update customer interaction history in Zep memory
    And the escalation should complete within 5 minutes

  Scenario: Enterprise customer immediate routing
    Given a customer with tier "enterprise"
    And the issue category is "critical"
    When a support ticket is submitted
    Then route to dedicated enterprise team via MCP toolkit
    And analyze issue complexity using LangChain
    And create high-priority workflow via Temporal
    And notify enterprise success manager via MCP toolkit
    And track resolution metrics in Zep memory

  Scenario: Standard customer self-service routing
    Given a customer with tier "standard"
    And the issue category is "billing" or "account"
    And self-service options are available
    When a support request is created
    Then analyze issue type using LangChain
    And present self-service options via MCP toolkit
    And if self-service fails, route to appropriate team
    And track customer satisfaction in Zep memory

  Scenario: Weekend and after-hours support
    Given a support request is submitted
    And the current time is outside business hours
    And the customer tier is "premium" or "enterprise"
    When the request requires immediate attention
    Then assess urgency using LangChain
    And if urgent, notify on-call manager via MCP toolkit
    And create after-hours workflow via Temporal
    And send acknowledgment to customer via MCP toolkit

  Scenario: Multi-language customer support
    Given a customer with preferred language other than English
    And the customer has submitted a support request
    When language detection is needed
    Then detect customer language using LangChain
    And route to appropriate language team via MCP toolkit
    And provide translated acknowledgment via MCP toolkit
    And ensure cultural context is preserved in Zep memory
