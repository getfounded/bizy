Feature: Enterprise Document Processing Workflows
  As a compliance officer
  I want automated document analysis and routing
  So that legal and financial documents are processed efficiently and accurately

  Background:
    Given the business logic orchestrator is running
    And LangChain document analyzer is available
    And Temporal workflow engine is running
    And document storage systems are accessible

  Scenario: Legal contract processing and review
    Given a legal contract document is uploaded
    And the contract value is above 100000
    And legal review is required
    When document processing is triggered
    Then extract contract terms and clauses using LangChain
    And identify key dates and obligations using LangChain
    And route to legal team for review via MCP toolkit
    And create contract review workflow via Temporal
    And store contract metadata in Zep memory
    And notify stakeholders of review status via MCP toolkit
    And the review process should complete within 3 business days

  Scenario: Financial document compliance check
    Given a financial document is uploaded
    And the document type is "audit" or "financial_statement"
    And compliance checking is enabled
    When document analysis is requested
    Then extract financial data using LangChain
    And validate against compliance rules using LangChain
    And if non-compliant, escalate to compliance team via MCP toolkit
    And create compliance review workflow via Temporal
    And generate compliance report via MCP toolkit
    And archive document with audit trail in Zep memory

  Scenario: Multi-language document translation workflow
    Given a document in a non-English language is uploaded
    And translation is required for processing
    And the document contains technical or legal content
    When translation workflow is initiated
    Then detect document language using LangChain
    And extract key sections for translation using LangChain
    And coordinate translation services via MCP toolkit
    And validate translation quality using LangChain
    And create bilingual processing workflow via Temporal
    And store translated versions in Zep memory

  Scenario: Large document batch processing
    Given multiple documents are uploaded simultaneously
    And the total document count is greater than 50
    And batch processing is enabled
    When bulk processing is triggered
    Then prioritize documents by type and urgency using LangChain
    And create parallel processing workflows via Temporal
    And coordinate batch analysis via Semantic Kernel
    And process high-volume data via FastMCP
    And consolidate results and metadata in Zep memory
    And generate batch processing report via MCP toolkit
    And notify completion to document owners via MCP toolkit

  Scenario: Sensitive document security workflow
    Given a document contains sensitive or confidential information
    And security classification is required
    And access controls must be applied
    When document security processing is needed
    Then classify document sensitivity using LangChain
    And apply appropriate security markings via MCP toolkit
    And restrict access based on classification via MCP toolkit
    And create secure workflow with audit logging via Temporal
    And track access and modifications in Zep memory
    And ensure compliance with data protection policies
